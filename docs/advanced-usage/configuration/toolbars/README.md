# Toolbars

The toolbar configuration in the Nova Ckeditor package allows you to define and customize multiple toolbars for the CKEditor field within your Laravel Nova application. Each toolbar consists of various options and items that control the available editing tools and features.

#### Toolbar Options

The toolbar configuration is defined in the `config/nova-ckeditor.php` file. Inside this file, you will find a `toolbars` key that contains an array of toolbar options. Each toolbar option represents a specific toolbar.
