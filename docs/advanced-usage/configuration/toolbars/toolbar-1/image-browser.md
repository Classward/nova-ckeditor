# Image Browser

| Property Name                    | Type | Default |
| -------------------------------- | ---- | ------- |
| toolbars.toolbar-1.browser.image | bool | true    |

This option allows you to enable or disable the image picker within the toolbar. By default, this option is set to `true`, indicating that the image picker is enabled.

The image picker provides a convenient way to select and insert images into the CKEditor field. However, in some cases, you may want to disable the image picker functionality.

To disable the image picker within Toolbar 1, update the value of `toolbars.toolbar-1.browser.image` in the `config/nova-ckeditor.php` file to `false`.
