This option allows you to define the toolbar buttons within the toolbar. This option provides flexibility to remove or rearrange the toolbar buttons according to your specific requirements.

By default, NovaCkeditor comes with a set of predefined buttons. However, you can customize the toolbar items by modifying the `toolbars.toolbar-1.items` configuration option. You can remove buttons that you don't need or rearrange their order as desired.

To customize the toolbar buttons within Toolbar 1, update the value of `toolbars.toolbar-1.items` in the `config/nova-ckeditor.php` file with the desired array of button items.
