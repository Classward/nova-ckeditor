# Max Image Quality

| Property Name | Type | Default |
| ------------- | ---- | ------- |
| max-quality   | int  | 75      |

The `max-quality` configuration option allows you to specify the maximum <mark style="color:red;">image</mark> output quality for image processing within the CKEditor field. This setting determines the level of compression applied to images when they are processed and resized.

By default, the `max-quality` configuration option is set to `75`. This value balances image quality and file size. However, you can adjust this value based on your specific requirements and preferences.

To configure the `max-quality` option, update the value in the configuration file `config/nova-ckeditor.php` with the desired maximum quality level.
