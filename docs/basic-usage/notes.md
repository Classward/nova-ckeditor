# Notes

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please note that by default, the video, audio and image file fields are **not updatable**. This means that replacing the media files may result in broken links.

The intended methodology for updating such files is to delete the existing file and then re-upload the new file. This ensures the integrity and proper functioning of the media files within your application.
