I would like to extend my appreciation and thanks to [bayareawebpro](https://github.com/bayareawebpro) for their work on the [nova-field-ckeditor](https://github.com/bayareawebpro/nova-field-ckeditor) package. The early versions of this package were inspired by their efforts and served as a reference during the development process. Their contribution has been instrumental in shaping the functionality and features of this package. Thank you for your valuable work and contribution to the Laravel Nova community.
